## Data Science 
The amount of data generated Data Science, one of the hottest topics in the tech industry right now, is a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning which adds some technology for ‘scaling up’ to ‘big data’. The purpose of data science is to extract insights from very huge amounts of data using scientific methods, processes, and systems. 

## Cloud Computing.
This is the process of storing, managing, and processing data online as opposed to a personal computer or local server. This online data is stored on a network of remote servers hosted on the internet. 
Data Science and Cloud computing. 
Because of the amount of big data generated daily, organizations are always looking for more efficient, economic and secure ways to store this data. But most importantly, organizations are also looking for efficient ways to analyse these large volumes of data so as to gain insights that will drive business, improve decision making and automate processes. This is what links Data Science – the analysis of this big data, to Cloud Computing – the storage of this big data. 

## Relevance to Uganda. 
Uganda, like the rest of world, is aboard this big data train. Many organizations, both non - profit and for profit, collect huge amounts of data on a daily basis. The need to have all this data economically stored is pertinent, and more so is the need to gain enhanced insights into this data. 
Proper analysis of these largely collected chunks of data can play a huge role in understanding major aspects;
•	In health – to gain insights into disease outbreaks, maternal care, service delivery, among others, 
•	In transport – understanding passenger movements so as to focus service delivery, 
•	In local government – gaining insights into what affects the common man and how to improve service delivery,
•	In the financial sector – to provide analytics on the best candidates for insurance and loans.

In order for Uganda to make headway and compete favourably in these fields, it’s critical that Ugandan universities incorporate data science courses into their curriculum. This is meant to equip as many Ugandans as possible with the necessary skills required to ready themselves of the inevitable future in these two fields.
