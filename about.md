I'm an enthusiastic IT technician with over 4 years of volunteering experience, managing IT services for Non-Profit Organisations. These services range but are not limited to hardware and application installations, computer systems configurations, firewall configurations, monitoring and maintaing of both hardware and software systems.

I underwent a 3 months IT internship programme with Advocates Coalition for Development and Environment(Acode Uganda, www.acode-u.org), a regional leading independent public policy research and advocacy think tank. This internship introduced me to the reality of managing and maintaining computer systems and networks of a much bigger number of employees. My communication skills were honed, and before long i was able to research and present technical data in a friendlier way. 

My current position as IT technician for Pioneer Easy Bus has introduced me to newer systems like camera surveillance and Fleet Management Systems. This has broadened my reach as an IT personnel, and has enabled me to be in a position to raise workable solutions in bus routing and increase of revenue for the company.
